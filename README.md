# Overview

Journapp is a very simple app that allows you to register journaling entries about what you did through out the day, pretty straight forward right? 

I wanted to get a feel of what React Native is like, this project was really fun to work with! 

# Development Environment

The application was built using VS Code, expo and npm for module management. 

Following React principles, the application was built in TypeScript and expo. 

# Useful Websites

* [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs)

# Future Work

* I tried to implement Nativewind, however some version issues and limitations related to not having an iOS system limited my ability to use it. I will check once the version errors have been fixed.  
* I will add camera and mic integration options so the user can record pictures, videos and audio records in the entries.
* The styling was kept in a basic stage because of time constrains, but I will improve it later on.
